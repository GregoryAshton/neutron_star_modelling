\block[]{I: What is a \emph{gravitational wave}?}{

In 1916 Einstein formulated his theory of gravity, general relativity. Like all
good theories it made several important predictions. Only one of these
predictions has not been experimentally tested: \emph{gravitational waves}.

Einstein unified the ideas of space and time into a single object which we call
\emph{spacetime}. Spacetime is a dynamic object that can interact with matter.
We can picture this by imagining a stretched rubber sheet on which we place
heavy weights, this creates wells in the sheet. In this picture the rubber
sheet is spacetime while the weights are large masses e.g. stars, black holes.

When a large non-symmetric mass rotates, it causes the spacetime to ripple as
illustrated in the figure on the left. These ripples are gravitational waves.
There is strong evidence that they exist, but they have not yet been
directly observed.

Stars like our sun are in an equilibrium between the outward force from burning
nuclear fuel and collapse due to their own gravity.  When they
run out of fuel they collapse and some form a neutron star.
They have a mass about that of our sun, but have a radius of about 10km, this
makes them extremely dense. This is like compressing the sun into a sphere
roughly the size of Southampton.

We see some neutron stars as pulses of electromagnetic light. This is caused by
radiation streaming out in thin beams which flash over the earth like the beams
from a lighthouse, illustrated on the left.  Because of their extreme
densities, if neutron stars are misshapen the gravitational waves they emit may be
measurable on earth.

\block[]{III: Searching for gravitational waves}{

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}

A gravitational wave will periodically stretch and squeeze space in the two
directions perpendicular to its direction of travel. In the figure below we 
show this effect on a circle. 
{
\begin{tikzfigure}
    \vspace{-10mm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\linewidth}
    \vspace{-10mm}
\begin{tikzfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/Ligo}
\end{tikzfigure}
\end{wrapfigure}

To detect gravitational waves we can use a laser interferometer. These split a
laser beam and send it off in two different directions; both beams are then
bounced off a mirror and return to the start. Both beams should have travelled
the same distance and so should return at the same time. However, if a
gravitational wave passed through during the experiment, they will not both
return at the same time. 

\end{minipage}
\hspace{2mm}
\vrule{}
\hspace{2mm}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}

The problem is that the difference between the two beams is tiny.  To put
it in perspective, it's like trying to measure if a human being has grown by a
single atom. We have built enormous interferometers in the hope of measuring
gravitational waves, for example here is one of the 4 km long LIGO detectors:

\block[]{IV: Searching for signals from neutron stars}{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\linewidth}
    \vspace{-33mm}
    \begin{tikzfigure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{img/CGW_example}
    \end{tikzfigure}
\end{wrapfigure}

The signals we are searching for will be hidden in the  \emph{detector noise}
from seismic activity. To find them, we make an educated guess for what the
signal will look like and  compare it to the data, like in the graph on the
right. Using the correct guess is crucial to finding the signal.
Unfortunately it is possible that real gravitational wave signals will contain
\emph{other noise} from the neutron star itself. This neutron star noise may
look just like the detector noise, this  makes it hard to find the signal. I am
trying to test how bad this effect will be and develop methods to improve our
chances of detection.

\block[]{V: Gravitational waves astronomy}{
Aside from testing Einstein's general relativity, gravitational waves will
allow us to explore the universe in a new way. Traditional astronomy observes
electromagnetic radiation from distant objects. This means we can only observe
the outside of hot, light emitting objects. With gravitational wave astronomy
we may be able to observe more of the difficult to explore areas of physics
such as black holes, neutron stars, and maybe even the big bang. 
}

\column{0.5}
\block[]{VI: Conclusions}{
Scientists from around the world are trying to detect gravitational waves.
Finding these is crucial evidence for Einstein's theory of gravity, general
relativity. Here in the gravity group of Southampton, we are helping by
modelling neutron stars. We use these models to predict what the signals may
look like. I am interested in finding out what happens when the signals include
noise from the neutron star.

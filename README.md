# ReadMe for nsmod

Motivation
----------

This project aims to provide a flexible set of tools to model a neutron star, and appropriate methods to plot the results. This is done through a set of modules accesed via `nsmod.py`. The modules should be accessible from the command line (see `nsmod.py -h` provided the directory has been added to `PATH`), and from a python interpretor such as `IPython`. 

Dependencies 
------------

* Python 2.7 
* Python modules : numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py
* Cython 
* hdf5 
* PyTables 
* C compiler such as `gcc`

Model
-----

The model is implemented through `nsmod.Model`. Currently two functions exist:

* `Run(Input Dictionary)` : Standard single component model
* `Run_Cython_Two_Component` : *NEW" Two component model

\block[]{I: Motivations}{
Astrophysics contains a huge number of interesting observed phenomena, let alone
those that we have yet to see. The problem we often have is that 
that our observations are in a low signal to noise regime; this can mean
several models can explain the observed data. 

In this poster we discuss a method for quantitatively assessing how well several
models fit some data. The aim being to decide, eventually, given the observed 
data which astrophysical model do we think is most likely.

\block{II: Bayesian Data Analysis}{
While many methods exist for comparing some models, an intuitive approach can
be found by using Bayes rule
\begin{equation}
    p(\model|\data) = p(\data|\model) \frac{p(\model)}{p(\data)}
    \label{eqn: bayes}
\end{equation}
where by $P(\model|\data)$ we mean "The probability of $\model$, given that 
we have observed some $\data$.

}

\end{columns}

\block{III: Model comparison}{
The issue with Bayes rule as written in eqn.(\ref{eqn: bayes}) is that 
$p(\data)$ is often difficult, or even impossible to define. Instead, we can
compare two models, say $M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$ by looking at the ratio
\begin{equation}
    \frac{p(M_{A}|\data)}{p(M_{B}|\data)} = 
    \frac{p(\data| M_{B})}{p(\data|M_{A})}
    \frac{p(M_{A})}{p(M_{B})}
\end{equation}
This ratio can directly be interpreted as the 'odds ratio', or how much more
we should believe model $A$ of $B$ given the data. The last fraction reflects
our prior knowledge about the two models. Unless we have a strong reason to
believe otherwise this is generally set to unity: $p(M_{A}) = p(M_{B})$.

\block{IV: Signals in noise}{
The key to data analysis is to define our 'likelihood' function: the
probability of the data given the model $p(\mathrm{data}|\mathrm{model})$. To 
calculate this we must first assume that the observed data is the sum of a
a deterministic signal and a central Gaussian noise process. That is we can
write the observed data as
\begin{equation}
    W(t) = f(t; \vec{\theta}) + n(t; \sigma).
\end{equation}
Here $f(t; \vec{\theta})$ is the signal model with parameters $\vec{\theta}$,
while $n(t; \sigma)$ is the noise process with strength $\sigma$. 
If we subtract the signal model (with the correct parameters) from the observed
data we should be left with Gaussian noise:
$W(t) - f(t; \vec{\theta}) = n(t; \sigma)$.
Then the probability of a single observed data point at $t_{i}$
\begin{equation}
    p(W(t_{i})|\mathrm{model}, \vec{\theta}, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}e^{-\frac{(W(t_{i}) - f(t_{i})}{2\sigma^{2}}}
\end{equation}
Here the model, and hence the function $f(t)$, are yet to be determined. Given
a sequence of $N$ observations (e.g. some data) we can compute the likelihood
function as
\begin{equation}
    p(\mathrm{data}|\mathrm{model}, \vec{\theta}, \sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}p(W(t_{i})|\mathrm{model}), \vec{\theta}, \sigma
    \label{eqn: likelihood}
\end{equation}

To illustrate how we can apply Bayesian data analysis consider the data
shown in the figure below. This is a plot of the measured beam width
of pulsar B1828-11 showing a distinct periodic behaviour. This data was 
originally published in figure 5 of [1], we are thankful
to the original authors for allowing us access to this data.

Prior to this paper, slow periodic modulation of the spin-down was cited as
evidence for precession in this pulsar. Clearly the beam width is also being 
modulated at this same time-scale. The authors argue that the beam width is
not smoothly varying between, but instead \emph{switching}. This has important
implications for neutron star physics.\\

\column{0.5}
\block[]{VI: Model A}{
The simplest model we can propose to explain the periodic features is a simple
trig. function. This does not capture all of the physics of alternative models,
but nevertheless will test the assumption that $W_{10}$ switches instantaneously
between two values. The signal function for this model is
\begin{equation}
    f(t; W_{0}, A, f, \phi_{0}) = W_{0} + A\sin(2\pi f t + \phi_{0}) 
    \label{eqn: A}
\end{equation}
}

\column{0.5}
\block[]{VII: Model B}{
The model proposed by the authors can be captured by a simple square wave. We
then make an assumption that the observed data is the sum of a square wave and
noise.
\begin{equation}
    g(t; W_{0}, A, f, \phi_{0}) = W_{0} + \mathrm{square}(t\; W_{0}, A, f, \phi_{0}) 
    \label{eqn: B}
\end{equation}

\block{VIII: Marginalisation and odds ratio}{
Plugging the model functions \ref{eqn: A} and \ref{eqn: B} into the likelihood
\ref{eqn: likelihood} we have $P(\data| M_{i}, \vec{\theta}, \sigma)$. The next
step is to marginalise over all the model parameters:

\begin{equation}
    p(\data)| M_{i}) = \int \int p(\data | M_{i}, \vec{\theta}, \sigma) p(\vec{\theta}) p(\sigma) d\vec{\theta}d\sigma
\end{equation}

Often this integral will be unfeasible analytically, instead we can turn to 
numerical method such as MCMC and nested sampling.

\column{\mycolwidth}
\block{IX: Results}{
The observed beam width data was tested with both a sinusoidal model and a
square-wave model. We computed the marginal likelihoods using MCMC software
\emph{dan.iel.fm/emcee}. This resulted in an odds ratio:
\begin{equation}
    \log_{10}\left(\frac{p(M_{A}| \data)}{p(M_{B}| \data)}\right) = -6
\end{equation}
This establishes that the square wave model proposed by the authors significantly
out performs a sinusoidal model. We are currently in the process of exploring
more physical models to further probe the assumptions.

abstract = {Two types of non-secular changes in pulsar frequency f have been reported. One is a sudden small frequency jump $\Delta$f in both NP 0532 (the Crab pulsar)1,2 and PSR 0833 (the Vela pulsar)3,4. The other is a slow, small amplitude “wobble” of frequency v in the Crab pulsar frequency5. A number of explanations for the jumps have been put forward, based on the model of a pulsar as a rotating neutron star: (1) the near passage of a planet in an orbit of high eccentricity (unpublished work of Michel); (2) a fluid instability caused by the crust of the neutron star rotating more slowly than its core6; (3) a sudden relaxation of strains which have built up in the stellar crust (starquake)7,8. Suggested mechanisms for the wobble include: (a) induced motion by yet another planet5; (b) free precession of a non-spherical star (unpublished work of Chiuderi and Occhionero); (c) normal mode vibrations of quantized vortex lines within the rotating superfluid core9.},

Planetary companions are considered to be easiest to detect in short period pulsars that have attenuated spindown rates, including the millisecond pulsar population and other objects that have endured acretion-induced quenching of the magnetic field. Detectability of multiple planets is considered for large ranges of mass and orbital period. A Bayesian approach is advocated to compare planetary vs. spin noise interpretations of the timing data from a given pulsar.},

@article{Stairs2000,
abstract = {Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that produce lighthouse-like beams of radio emission from their magnetic poles. The observed pulse of emission enables their rotation rates to be measured with great precision. For some young pulsars, this provides a means of studying the interior structure of neutron stars. Most pulsars have stable pulse shapes, and slow down steadily (for example, see ref. 20). Here we report the discovery of long-term, highly periodic and correlated variations in both the pulse shape and the rate of slow-down of the pulsar PSR B1828-11. The variations are best described as harmonically related sinusoids, with periods of approximately 1,000, 500 and 250 days, probably resulting from precession of the spin axis caused by an asymmetry in the shape of the pulsar. This is difficult to understand theoretically, because torque-free precession of a solitary pulsar should be damped out by the vortices in its superfluid interior.},

@article{Shaham1977,
abstract = {Vortex pinning affects neutron-star free precession by modifying its frequency and geometry, in a gyroscopic effect. For neutron stars with low oblateness, the free-precession frequency is given by the product of the ratio of moments of inertia of the pinned superfluid to the rigid component of the rest of the star times half the superfluid vorticity. This poses a severe difficulty for any interpretation of the 35-day cycle of Her X-1 in terms of neutron-star wobble if vortex pinning exists.},
